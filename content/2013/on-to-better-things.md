Summary: Migrating my code blog to my personal domain

Pretty odd to have committed to writing 100 meaningful blog posts this year, and then promptly not post until Jan 6th. But as you can tell, my excuse is that I was spending all weekend building my new blog. Well I'm glad to say, *[here it is](http://blog.sitongpeng.com)*.

I'm now running on the static site generator, [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/). It's awesome because it is actively developed (version 3.1.1 as of 12/4/12) and it is written in Python, which means I didn't have to default to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's not that I'm averse to Jekyll, I'd just rather work in the language I'm most comfortable in (*not Ruby*). Anyways, things I'm most excited about:

* Writing all my posts in Markdown
* Being hosted on Github Pages
* Having all my posts saved on my Dropbox
* New syntax highlighting color scheme
* Actually using my own domain

I'm planning on writing about my experience building this blog in a post later this week. Stay tuned.
