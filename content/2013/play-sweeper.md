Summary: Marketing my javascript minesweeper game

Been working on this for the last couple days. It's my first, real foray into writing in Javascript since I don't count the couple of functions I've written for my websites. It uses a bit of JQuery. A lot of learning went into the creation of this game so I might write more about that business later. But yeah, for now.. Play [sweeper](http://stoneg.github.com/sweeper/sweeper.html).
