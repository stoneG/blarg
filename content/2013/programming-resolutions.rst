Last year was the first year in a long time that I did not make any
resolutions over the year. I’d like to get back to it this year, with a
few that I should be able to keep.

1. Articulation: 100 posts about programming things I’ve encountered and want to share.

2. Get involved: Contribute a couple patches or a bug fix to an open source project.

3. Push myself: Do a weekend project and get it on the front page of HN.

4. Read more books: I need to expand my knowledge beyond just reading the news and blogs.
