Summary: My plans for the rest of the first half of 2013

In the next couple months, I'm planning on writing more about `Javascript` as I pick it up in work and from my own reading. Towards the end of [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com), I decided I wanted to explore it as my second programming language. Reasoning: I can return to my functional programming roots and I can round out my understanding of web development by getting intimate with how the browser works.

However, this doesn't mean I will stop developing in `Python`. Aside from [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) exposure at work, I'm planning to continue building web applications for myself - and hopefully with more robust front-end UI.

But, that's not quite good enough. If there was one thing I took away from Hacker School, it was the idea that I should always be pushing myself to become a better programmer. Web development is fun and lets me exercise my creative side, but I want to step outside my comfort zone and pursue other avenues of technology too. I'm not entirely sure what direction I'll look but I think my best bet is to attach myself to an open source project and develop a deep understanding of that problem space.

Anyways, I'll think on that and come back with my decision within the next month. Hold me to it!
