Summary: My first Vim shortcut

There comes a point, usually after you've been using something for awhile, when you realize you are no longer just using it casually. And ***no***, I'm not talking about drugs.

I'm talking about defining my ***first*** shortcut key in my `vimrc`.

I was first introduced to [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) by my [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com) buddy [James](http://www.jamesshieh.com). For those of you who don't know, Vim is a very peculiar text editor. It is an "improved" version of [Vi](http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/)
