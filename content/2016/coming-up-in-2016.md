Summary: My plans for what is coming up in 2016

It’s been a few years since I’ve done this [publicly](/posts/programming-resolutions.html), but I’d like to bring this tradition back. Learning from past experiences, I’m keeping this list concise and specific. Life can sometimes get in the way but here’s what I’m agreeing to in 2016:

1. Ship something in virtual reality.
2. Write 8 posts worthy of reading.
3. Hike at two national parks, preferably new.
4. Live in a foreign country that's new to me.
5. Develop a fluidity in the kitchen so most dishes I make are served on time.
6. Be able to name all common herbs & spices by sight & smell.
7. Accomplish at least two physical goals for surfing, snowboarding, skiing, or weightlifting.

Time's ticking.
