Summary: Talking about resolutions for 2017

1. Read 18 books, at least 3 nonfiction.  
<span class="note">I’ve always averaged 5 books/year but I’d like to make reading more of a priority this year.</span>
2. Commit to a longer side project (At least 3 months).  
<span class="note">I have at least one in mind :)</span>
3. Accomplish two physical milestones.  
<span class="note">Potential examples: train for another run or swim or bike race, complete a major hike/trek, do a muscle up, etc...</span>
4. Accomplish two creative milestones.  
<span class="note">Potential examples: getting better at freestyle hip hop, art, music, or even food composition/plating.</span>

Can't wait.
